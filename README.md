### Technologies

* Java 7 for the core modules, Java 8 for everything else
* [Gradle 3.4+](https://gradle.org/) - for building the project
* [Google Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf) - for use with serialization and hardware communications

### Getting started

To get started, it is best to have the latest JDK and Gradle installed. The HEAD of the `master` branch contains the latest development code and various production releases are provided on feature branches.

#### Building from the command line

To perform a full build use
```
gradle clean build
```
You can also run
```
gradle javadoc
```
to generate the JavaDocs.

The outputs are under the `build` directory.

#### Building from an IDE

Alternatively, just import the project using your IDE. [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) has Gradle integration built-in and has a free Community Edition. Simply use `File | New | Project from Existing Sources` and locate the `build.gradle` in the root of the cloned project source tree.

### Example applications

These are found in the `examples` module.
